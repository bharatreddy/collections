It really has gotten me into programming and I will definitely be doing more of this in the future!', u'I also wanna say thanks to Cay and Sara and Udacity for a great course!!!! Loved it!', u'It was an amazing course... A big thanks to Cay and Sara...', u\"I've learnt so much!! Thank you very much for this amazing course!!!\", u'Thank you. I would like a more advanced course.', u'Great Class and hats off to Cay and Sara.

I must have missed that conceptual explanation in the videos.  ', u'great explanation! Thank you!!!!', u\"I'll be printing a copy of this for the exam.  Thanks!\", u'great explanation!', u'WOW!', u'This is great! Thank you very much!', u'For Those of You that Want to Understand the Geometry', u'This was presented previously. Below is the link to that  post:', u'4000/diameter\\ndone', u'Always hated geometry in high school. Now I see how important it is....', u'So, if we have \\n800 + N400sqrt(3)=4000\\nN should be \\nN= (4000-800)/400*sqrt(3) = 4.61\\nWhere is the \"+1\"  of the answer???', u'Here\\'s a hint. Look at her \"heights\" per row she draws at the beginning of the video. You can see a pattern.', u\"Really so so confused.  Don't understand the question, the video or this.\", u'I like Sara!', u'Yeah it is nice to have two people teaching us', u\"I really like that I don't feel bad if I make an error and Sara explains how to do it correctly step by step in a way that wouldn't make anyone feel bad about themselves.\", u'Amazing teachers.', u'I like the dynamic of this course as well, having both the Prof. ans Sarah doing the videos.', u\"I agree. It's nice to have both of them. It's a lot more refreshing this way.\", u'I like Sara too but they need to up they volume on her mic a bit.  very hard to hear.', u'I agree completely.', u'All of you here sound kinda like: ', u'I just wondered all saras in the world have the same sound or not :-\" ', u\"Really dedicated teachers. I like the format too where Prof teaches us new concepts and Sara for practice problems. But I am afraid  she speaks too quickly. Where as Prof speaks at 'okay speed'. \", u'Cheat Sheet for All 3 Exams', u'Cortez, I just wanted to give you a shout out and let you know that you are a life saver!', u'May I suggest you make this modification?:', u'Thanks! I was too lazy to create my own and this really helped.', u'Got any cheatsheet for exam 2 in the works?  :)', u'Thanks so much! I was stuck on a problem during the test and this really helped me!', u'Thank you.', u'Is it me, or did anyone else find themselves a little TOO dependent on cheat sheets and internet searches on the exam?', u'Thank you! It is very useful!', u'The final is open notes!', u'Hello, do you mind to post cheat sheet for lessons 8 ~ 9 please? ', u'Instructions Are Not Very Clear', u'Vince, actually I completely agree with you...I am generally enjoying this course because the general nature of the course is to teach the basics of JAVA and the prof. Horstman and team is doing a wonderful job at it, kudos to them...at the same time at times it is just frustrating since the quizzes seem to take too much time to resolve unnecessarily. This could be fixed in 2.0 upgrades!', u\"So I'm not sure if this is what you're asking, but the numbers aren't arbitrarily chosen. Here's how I got to 51. The trick is that they want 6 total numbers but you must include 0 and 255. This means that now there are only 4 numbers equidistantly spread throughout the range.\", u'The first part of the equation (Color * 6)/256 tells us which of the six segments our color is in.  We need to convert the segment number to a color value (0-256). Each of the six segments covers 1/6th of 256 values (51).  Multiplying by 51 converts the segment number into a color value.', u'finally found the answer as below..', u'so I guess the equations should look something like below..here the multiplication factors (i.e. 255, 204 and 153 are arbitrary)\\n        red = (red * 255) / 256;\\n        green = (green * 204) / 256;\\n        blue = (blue * 153) / 256;\\nI am not sure what the right combinations would be for this quiz to work...anyone?', u'Why did you multiply by 51?', u'same question here ,why did you multiply by 51 ?', u'Hi, \\nI really dont understand this question, however, from the previous videos I figured out that this equation will work\\nred = ((red * 6)/256)*51;', u\"I saw that the instructions were WRONG.  You don't multiply by 5 to spread it back out, but rather multiply it by 51.\", u'Say you have a value of 255.  you reduce it to 5.  Then for display you want it to go back to 255, thus you multiply it by 51.\\n0 * 51 = 0\\n1 * 51 = 51\\n2* 51 = 102\\n3 * 51 = 153\\n4 * 51 = 204\\n5 * 51 = 255', u'Needed information', u\"Agreed. If you hadn't posted the name of that method here, I would have had no idea what to call. Thanks!\", u'I totally agree. This course often require previous functions but does not provide reference. I had to navigate back which costs me much time.', u'In some cases, it is helpful to open up the accompanying code in BlueJ.', u\"I'd classify this as a minor bug in the course. It would be quick to add the method name in a comment in the code (in the web IDE). Hopefully Udacity will fix this (but it seems like they don't often go back and fix bugs :(  )\", u'Why did I have to add a constructor?', u'the following text is from the java tutorials', u'Answer is already filled in....', u\"I've taken other online programming courses before.  This course is very well down compared to the other classes.  Any glitches I've seen have been very minor and any significant glitches seem to be resolved quickly.\", u\"I don't know what was going on there, but Lecture 6.1 has a lot of issues, feels like it was pushed out in a rush\", u\"My guess is they needed to make this class available by a certain date to meet the summer school schedule for San Jose State, so they didn't have time to check everything carefully.\", u'Two months after this thread was first posted, the answer is still filled in :P', u'I also changed my index and I don\\'t get those \"secret messages.\"', u'I felt so smart on this one. took me like 2 seconds. hahaha', u'This question requires a Vulcan mind meld with the professor', u'... so the only variable you really care about is radius so all the others are not appropriate.', u'I am all in favor of a Vulcan mind meld to impart programming best practices to students.', u'I was wondering about that question too when I first saw it. ', u\"i dont think this question is valid simply because you dont know what information you will receive about the circle. Who says im going to have the radius? And to top this off the question has damn near nothing to do with programming. I really don't care either way, I just think it's pointless.\", u'I see what you\\'re saying, but you have to consider that this is NOT a real program. We don\\'t know what information we\\'re going to receive so how should we know what is proper or not? it is not about \"elegant programming\" because I do understand that, it\\'s about the context of the question itself!', u\"NO, KIRK!!! DON'T REVEAL YOUR IDENTITY!!!\", u'In this case, the Vulcan mind meld can actually be accomplished by reading the instructor notes.', u'Yeah! Vulcan mind - that is good to have - than you will destroy all evil toilets in der N\\xe4he! - my mother said :)', u\"This is a ridiculous question that isn't really related to what was taught. It should be removed from the course.\", u'Wrong book to remove given in the comments', u'Also, there is another version of remove() that just uses the object name so you can write', u'I did it 5 minutes ago, and the right answer was removing  \"Why zebras don\\'t get ulcers by Robert M. Sapolsky\". ', u'Appears to have been fixed. Correct answer now matches comment and not video.', u'or, indeed', u'And which book need to remove?', u'The correct line to put in  is supposed to be booksToRead.remove(\"The Brain That Changes Itself by Norman Doidge\"); but there is a bug/error in the Udacity coding envirement, so you have to enter in  ', u'When I run the line', u'wrong book for me also', u'The code is wrong! should be i<word.length(), not <=', u'Indeed the code will throw an index out of bounds exception as it attempts to access the string past its length.', u\"It's really ironic that this bug appears in the code right after several videos talking about fence-post errors!  Must be some kind of Freudian thing.\", u'I wish I could use \"Oops\" on my exam!', u\"I'm surprised that they didn't test the course before they posted it. Even testing with a few people would have revealed these errors. \", u'It actually prints zero numbers...', u'good catch !!! ', u'hehehe that is funny. ', u'Would it be too much to ask for some consistency for things that are not the focus of the question?', u\"The quizz is about formatted output, not checking for trick quote marks that are or are not there, or even by why you need a decimal number to represent cereal boxes.  Let's keep the syntax-proofing for later.  At this point it just distracts from the real object of the lesson and makes a lot of people who are new to this, more insecure than they should be... and it kind of annoys a lot of others.\\nTeaching formatting gradually (if that's what they're doing) has a lot less virtue than teaching consistency when it come to programming.\", u'I was very confused, too, for precisely the reasons that Dell states. However, the formatting section of the instructor notes covers what should have been explained in the video. ', u\"@Franck, exactly my point.  It is both confusing and needlessly annoying to have so much 'mystery' sauce (separated form fields into two sections with no clear rationale or explanation for example).\", u\"I guess they want you to gradually learn the formatting, so they break it down for the first question and then make you put in quotes and things in the rest. If you listened in the video, the two boxes in the first question were for a number and a letter. Also, as you're not actually writing out the real code, there's no real need to create a new line ('\\\\n') at this stage, hence why they don't require it.\", u'Once at the answer there is a \"back to quiz\" button. Even at the video instructions there is a \"Skip to Quiz\" button.', u\"@June -- what are you waiting to hear about the debugger?   Yes, they will cover the debugger well.  I'm not sure what you are asking about multiple classes in BlueJ.   Perhaps you are wondering how to open a set of Java files that do not have a BlueJ project associated?  IIRC, it's just \", u'Yeah my error on this lesson was to think that on the first question would be like the following questions: i answer on one square 6D and have no idea why there was a 2nd one.', u'[INFO] How to format code $%\\\\color{magenta}{nicely}$% in the forums', u'For those among you who are not familiar with $%\\\\LaTeX$%, here are some examples to get you started:', u'[> including any of the following: <, >, <=, >=. Within code /code these', u\"Isn't the description ambiguous too?\", u'What does \"non-matching bricks\" mean?  Does it mean not matching the required order (blue before yellow)?  That was what I interpreted but Sara interpreted it as \"not the same color\".  This is ambigous.', u'\"in order\" in this context means the order that Cay and Sarah have been talking about - blue blocks to the left followed by yellow blocks', u'\"Sorted in to groups of the same color\" or similar would be more explicit. What does it mean to put colors \"in order\" (from a human point of view)? Is yellow greater or less than blue?', u'I gave the right answer, but I think the algorithm is ambiguous too. \\nEven if the expression \"in order\" was explained by the Instructor Notes, what about the meaning of the word \"first\"?\\nShould the robot start from the right or from the left?\\nIn strict terms, the algorithm can\\'t terminate... because it can\\'t even begin.\\nThanks for your attention.', u'I agree that. the instructions are ambiguous.  I thought that all answers were correct. There is no standard in computer science about the order blocks should be in.', u'For multiple-choice question with one answer always need to select option with clearly defined conditions. Otherwise probability of the mistake is a very high. ;-)', u'I think that description is ambiguous.\\nMoreover, I think \"set of instructions\" can be an algorithm if it does not always terminate. It is incorrect algorithm for this task, but why it\\'s not an algorithm?', u'The description is less clear than a speach from Jean Claude Van Damme', u'xD Yet another self-anchoring problem. ', u'Petition! Stop the discontinuation of free certificates!', u'How are they taking away \"this beautiful thing that is free education\" by not offering free certification? They are still offering the education! Free certification is largely meaningless. Either you have enough credibility (proof that you are serious, that you apply yourself to what you attempt to learn -- through other education or through demonstrating your knowledge by what you can do with it) that you can convince a potential employer that you have actually mastered the content of a free course, certification or not, or you don\\'t.

Cell phones for \"only $ per month (first year only, fine print, yada yada\",  furniture loans with \"no interest for 6 months\" etc.  Western nations are used to this slightly misleading marketing technique, but it does not mean consumers like it.

I\\'m a complete beginner in programming and the exercises given are already advanced. Are we supposed from this point on \"code\" in BlueJ on how to compose the code already? The steps confuses me.', u'I too need a more detailed explanation. How and where are we to execute this pseudocode? Are we supposed to place it in the parenthesis in System.out.println.();? This part of the lesson requires more detail due to the fact that for some of us it is our first experience with attempting to code. An example would be greatly appreciated. ', u'I would concur on the above I am also a bit lost on how to make this work as it is the first time I am trying to program at all.', u\"I have to agree.  I was brand new to any sort of programming, & I had such a hard time that I looked for another MOOC.  I found one that made so much more sense, & it had me writing & trying out more programs sooner than this MOOC does.  I came back here to learn material that complements what I learned in the other MOOC, & I understand where some of this stuff is going, but, as before, I'm finding the instructions difficult.  Sometimes when I see the answer, I understand what the speaker intended, but it's just not clearly laid out in the presentation of the problem.  \", u'This one: http://mooc.cs.helsinki.fi/programming-part1', u\"I'm guessing that people are struggling with the logic of pseudo-coding as opposed to the actual coding examples (which are really straightforward).    It is also interesting to note that this is the biggest problem I have in finding great programming resources -- they can hack like crazy but can't think their way out of a problem.\", u'Word to the Wise...', u'thank you so much', u'yep, I forgot the brackets too. Thank You for the reminder', u'@Sagar-21 You fotgot to Capitalise one word. Look more closely at the names.add(\"Cal\");', u'a poorly stated question. vague and lack clarity.', u'Mine validated without square brackets - presumably because I did not use toString().\\nAnn, Cal validated.', u'...sufficient!!', u'Needed information - Same problem here than in the pervious question', u\"I agree. For problems this short, there's no need to download and open up a bunch of BlueJ files just to get one method name. That's a waste of time unless you have a burning need to get into the guts of the program.\", u'All of the needed information is in BlueJ class code. Cay even shows you where the information is in BlueJ in the answer videos. ', u'At first I was frustrated also with this approach.  But then it got me thinking that maybe they changed the approach to make us show us  how  the OOP works. In writing code for the answers this unit is more complex than the previous ones, and  there should be tabs for every class in the udacity IDE. In BleuJ is easier to follow how the class are coupled with each other based on the diagrams (to draw the ball you have to notice the Ball class is coupled with the Ellipse and then find the method to draw the ball in this class). If one day you decide to program in Java or another OOP you will encounter classes from other programmers. It is important to understand how this things works and where to look if you want to implement another class. ', u'guys, it says to use the getMeasure() method.it says we convert the getArea() & getFuelEfficiency()  methods to getMeasure() in order to be able to use them in the interface.']\n"
